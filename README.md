# Homework2
2nd Homework 

Start by creating three .html pages, one for each link of my bio page
Include a link to bootstrap in each <head>, use the same <title>, <header> and <nav> for each page
In the <nav> bar create an href for each page so that you can access any of the pages with a hyperlink

On the index.html page create a container for the about me section and link to google font for better styling
Create a row for the about me heading and also my bio picture
Link my picture to the page and add in float so that the <p> text wraps around the picture 
Add in personal information/quick bio in the <p> section

On the portfolio.html I took code from bootstrap to create interactive images. 
I added jpegs to the page and titled them according to the homework example. They are not linked to anything as I have not created anything I am proud of as of yet to link these pictures to.

On the contact.html page I added in code form bootstrap to create forms to enter in a users name, email address and message. 

For my styling I added a css page to change the styling of my header to include a background color, text alignment, box model styling and a font. I also did this for the navigation bar.
On my index.html page I added styling to the about me heading to style a background color, box model and font. 
For my portfolio page I did text align and box model and also changed the font of my portfolio heading.
On the contact page I added in width to change the width of each form box and also added in a margin and padding to fit the page in a more pleasing way.
